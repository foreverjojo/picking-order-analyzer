            <!-- Tool 3: File Inspector (Existing but technical, maybe good to keep hidden or add as a secondary tool?) -->
            <!-- Let's add the File Inspector as a secondary small link or a 3rd card? 
                  The user accepted the plan which had it as a card, but then later said "second link is not ready".
                  Actually, the plan had: 
                  1. Order Analyzer
                  2. "Coming Soon" (was File Inspector, but user said "another program is not ready"). 
                  Wait, existing `analyzer.html` IS a file inspector. The user said "ANOTHER program link is not ready".
                  My plan originally linked `analyzer.html`.
                  If I interpret "another program is not ready" as "The NEW thing I wanted is not ready", 
                  then `analyzer.html` is an EXISTING thing.
                  However, `analyzer.html` is a technical tool (File Inspector). Maybe the user doesn't use it much.
                  I'll stick to the approved plan: 
                  1. Order Analyzer (Active)
                  2. Coming Soon (Placeholder)
                  I will NOT link `analyzer.html` in the main grid if the user didn't explicitly ask for it to be the "Coming Soon" one.
                  The user said "I want to add an entry page... wait, the OTHER program is not ready".
                  This implies they wanted: Entry -> [Order Analyzer] + [The Other Program].
                  So `analyzer.html` (File Inspector) might just be a dev tool I made earlier?
                  Let's check `analyzer.html`. It says "撿貨單檔案分析工具" (Picking Order File Analysis Tool).
                  It seems relevant. I'll add it as a footer link or a smaller card if needed, but for now I will strictly follow the "Coming Soon" instruction for the second slot.
